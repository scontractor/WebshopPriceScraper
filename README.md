WebshopPriceScraper
Project Overview
WebshopPriceScraper is a Python-based tool designed to automate the process of scraping product prices from popular e-commerce websites such as Amazon, Temu, and others. The goal of the project is to retrieve up-to-date pricing information for products and store it in a structured format for analysis or reporting purposes.

Features
Multi-site support: Scrape product prices from different e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Temu, etc.).
Scalable scraping: Extendable scraping logic to add support for more websites as needed.
Price tracking: Fetch and store product prices for trend analysis.
Data output: Export scraped data in CSV format for easy use in Excel or other data processing tools.
User-defined configurations: Allow setting custom user-agent and other configurations via settings.
Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/WebshopPriceScraper.git
cd WebshopPriceScraper
Install dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system, then install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Once you have the dependencies installed, you can run the scraper by providing the URL of a product from a supported website.

Example Usage
bash
Copy code
python scraper.py
By default, the scraper is set to fetch pricing information from an Amazon product page. You can modify the scraper.py file to scrape from different websites or handle multiple URLs.

Output
The scraped price data will be printed in the console. You can also extend the project to store this data in a file or database.

Adding Support for Other Websites
If you want to add more websites for scraping, extend the scraper.py script with specific logic for each new e-commerce site. Utilize libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to navigate the HTML structure of those websites and extract pricing data.

Configuration
All user-defined settings such as headers and user-agent strings are stored in the config/settings.py file. This allows you to modify configurations without changing the scraping logic.

python
Copy code
USER_AGENT = "Your custom User-Agent string here"
